<!-- 
    <!DOCTYPE html> is an HTML5 document type declaration. It is used to specify to 
    the web browser which version of HTML the document is using.
    
    In HTML5, <!DOCTYPE html> is a simple and standardized way to declare the document 
    type. It tells the browser to render the document in standards mode, which ensures 
    consistent behavior across different browsers.

    The DOCTYPE declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document before
    the <html> tag. It is not an HTML tag itself, but rather an instruction to the 
    browser about how to interpret the document.

    Prior to HTML5, DOCTYPE declarations were longer and more complex, but HTML5 simplified
    this to just <!DOCTYPE html>, making it easier for developers to write and understand 
    HTML documents.
