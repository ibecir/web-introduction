<!--
    In HTML, the <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, animations, and other 
    visual images on a webpage using JavaScript. It provides a drawable region 
    defined in HTML code, where you can dynamically generate and manipulate 
    graphics through JavaScript code.

    The <canvas> element itself doesn't have any inherent graphical capabilities; 
    instead, it serves as a container for graphics. You use JavaScript to access 
    the drawing context of the canvas (getContext('2d') for 2D graphics, or 
    getContext('webgl') for 3D graphics), and then you can use a variety of 
    methods to draw shapes, text, images, and more onto the canvas.
